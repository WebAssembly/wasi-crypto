# September 22nd, 2022

* Dan Gohman is going to review the current spec and see what changes might be required in order to make it consistent with other WASI APIs.
* Breaking API change: addition of a context to some functions that can't inherit one (@rjzak for the spec, likely @jedisct1 for the wasmtime/bindings implementations) - Issue #58
* Key attestation: some applications such as ENARX may require an attestation for keys. These are platform-dependent blobs. (@npmccallum). @jedisct1: we can introduce a generic function to get metadata about a key (public, secret, key pair) instead. How to ensure uniqueness of identifiers? Use UUIDs? (@npmccallum) Register to IANA? Or maybe better: maintain the registry within the wasi-crypto specification/repository.
* `symmetric_state_clone()` missing from the rust host implementation, due to issues with Rust. Make it a TODO in the `wasi-crypto` crate, not in the wasmtime glue (@rjzak, @jedisct1)
* Webcrypto algorithms are non normative. But having required algorithms would still be a good thing for wasi-crypto. Yet, FIPS complicance may be an issue. Split them in 4 categories: Required, recommended, optional, reserved. Only FIPS-approved algorithms must go into the "required" category (PR #77, @rjzak, @jedisct1)
